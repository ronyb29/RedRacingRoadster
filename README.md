# RedRacingRoadster
WiFi RC Car controller via a RESTful service that runs on a ESP8266 directly on the car.

## usage
Currently the module is meant to control two motors, each via its own H-Bridge, one for the acceleration (z-axis) and one for the steering (x-axis).


## TODO:
* Write better docs
* Migrate to OR Create a more flexible web server
* Migrate to a proper Json-POST based RESTful service
* Support decimal speed control for both axis 
* Add touch controls to the website for use in smarthpones
